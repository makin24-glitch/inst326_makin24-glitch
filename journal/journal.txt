Week 1 
   Sept 11, 2025 
        Formed our groups for team projects. Familiarized ourselves with journal entries on GitHub. 
        No AI was used but I believed I should document something for the first day of jouranaling. 

    Sept 12, 2025
        Used AI (ChatGPT) to detect discrepancies in MySQL for a lab assignemntm involving the beginner statements (SELECT, ORDER BY, and CONCAT).

    Sept 13, 2025 
        Used AI (ChatGPT) to explore/research beginner AIML projects and their scopes. 
        I have yet to make a decision on a project but I do enjoy learning more about AIML.

    Sept 14, 2025 
        Asked ChatGpt why use .format strings as suggested in Week 1 excercise.
        It gave me 4-5 reasons.
            1. Its cleaner than concatenation.
                Example code
                name = "Mylo"
                age = 21
                # Using concatenation
                s = "My name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old."
                # Using .format()
                s = "My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age)

            2. It is reusable and flexible. We can specify 
                Example code:
                s = "Coordinates: {1}, {0}".format("Y", "X")  # Output: "Coordinates: X, Y"
                s = "Hello {0}, meet {0}".format("Mylo")      # Output: "Hello Mylo, meet Mylo"

            3. Formatting numbers and values. .format() lets you control width, precision, alignment, etc.
                Example code:
                pi = 3.14159
                s = "Pi rounded to 2 decimals: {:.2f}".format(pi)  # "Pi rounded to 2 decimals: 3.14"

            4. Named placeholders.
                Example code: 
                s = "Name: {name}, Age: {age}".format(name="Mylo", age=21)

            5. But nowadays, f-stringd are preffered because of they're shorter, faster, and more readable. 
                Example code: 
                name = "Mylo"
                age = 21
                s = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."

            All in all. .format and f-strings methods are the preffered ways building strings dynamically because of their fasters and shorter process.

            

Week 2 
    Sept 18, 2025 
        Testing sync changes in journals from Visual Code.  
    
    Sept 20, 2025
        Experimented with ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek to which would be a useful resource in making my dashboard project. 
        Was introduced to Perplexity and explored its functions. 

    Sept 21, 2025 
        Had Claude explain to me Python concept like for and while loops, the meaning of "in range" in statements, and the significance of enumerating.


Week 3

    Sept 23, 2025 
        Most of my queries were regarding the Week 3 exercise assignment. 
        Mostly clarifying/demostrating Python concepts and interpreting a few the tasks in exercises. 
        For example, I learned about the zip() function while completing Exercise 11. specifying this function ensured
        both list were being iterated simultaneously rather then iterating through a whole list before looking at the other. 

        Exercise 11 Code: 
                

                def books_by_author_fuzzy(titles, authors, author_query):
                    matching_titles = []
                    for title, author in zip(titles, authors): # Use zip to iterate through both lists simultaneously
                        if author.strip().lower() == author_query.strip().lower():
                            matching_titles.append(title)
                    return matching_titles

    Sept 25, 2025 
        Recieved feedback on Week 02 Exercise. 
        
        Logging feedback here for referencing purposes:
        Problem 22 - "Uses .split("7") which only works if first digit is 7. Fails for other call numbers like "QA85.73.P98". Should loop until finding any digit. "
            Hard coded "7", Should loop unil finding any digt. 
        
        Problem 27 - Always prints warning, no conditional check. Should only warn if lengths don't match.4

Week 4 
    Oct 1, 2025
        Used Claude to breif me the most common functions and concepts used in Python.
        Used ChatGPT to develop an init file for our Group Project - Data Summurizing Dashboard.

    Oct 4, 2025 
        Used ChatGPT to research all career paths in Information Science. 
        Organized them in catergories of interest, salary, locations and other attribbutes. 


Week 5 
    Oct 7, 2025 
        Used ChatGPT to generate and organize a few functions for my team's dashboard project (setup logger (), 
                                                                                                load_library_data,
                                                                                                validate input(),
                                                                                                create_report(), and
                                                                                                generate_dashboard(),
                                                                                                ) 
        (Indented as such to form the habit of good Python code style)

        After that generate a few functions, I had guide in testing these functions which involved 
        making a new folder in the directory with sample data (data/sample_data.csv).

        STOPPED AT TRYING TO RUN TEST EXAMPLE AT APRROX 2:07 PM 

    Oct 11 to 12, 20225
    Used ChatGPT and Claude to revise the code for Week 5 exercises and team project.

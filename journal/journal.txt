Week 1 
   Sept 11, 2025 
        Formed our groups for team projects. Familiarized ourselves with journal entries on GitHub. 
        No AI was used but I believed I should document something for the first day of jouranaling. 

    Sept 12, 2025
        Used AI (ChatGPT) to detect discrepancies in MySQL for a lab assignemntm involving the beginner statements (SELECT, ORDER BY, and CONCAT).

    Sept 13, 2025 
        Used AI (ChatGPT) to explore/research beginner AIML projects and their scopes. 
        I have yet to make a decision on a project but I do enjoy learning more about AIML.

    Sept 14, 2025 
        Asked ChatGpt why use .format strings as suggested in Week 1 excercise.
        It gave me 4-5 reasons.
            1. Its cleaner than concatenation.
                Example code
                name = "Mylo"
                age = 21
                # Using concatenation
                s = "My name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old."
                # Using .format()
                s = "My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age)

            2. It is reusable and flexible. We can specify 
                Example code:
                s = "Coordinates: {1}, {0}".format("Y", "X")  # Output: "Coordinates: X, Y"
                s = "Hello {0}, meet {0}".format("Mylo")      # Output: "Hello Mylo, meet Mylo"

            3. Formatting numbers and values. .format() lets you control width, precision, alignment, etc.
                Example code:
                pi = 3.14159
                s = "Pi rounded to 2 decimals: {:.2f}".format(pi)  # "Pi rounded to 2 decimals: 3.14"

            4. Named placeholders.
                Example code: 
                s = "Name: {name}, Age: {age}".format(name="Mylo", age=21)

            5. But nowadays, f-stringd are preffered because of they're shorter, faster, and more readable. 
                Example code: 
                name = "Mylo"
                age = 21
                s = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."

            All in all. .format and f-strings methods are the preffered ways building strings dynamically because of their fasters and shorter process.

            

Week 2 
    Sept 18, 2025 
        Testing sync changes in journals from Visual Code.  
    
    Sept 20, 2025
        Experimented with ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek to which would be a useful resource in making my dashboard project. 
        Was introduced to Perplexity and explored its functions. 

    Sept 21, 2025 
        Had Claude explain to me Python concept like for and while loops, the meaning of "in range" in statements, and the significance of enumerating.
